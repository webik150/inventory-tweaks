## 1.18 Port of Inventory Tweaks
So I got fed up waiting for someone to update this and decided to try for myself. SO MUCH of Minecraft and Forge has changed since the 1.12 version. I'm close to a somewhat functional version, but no ETA.

### Rundown

* Sorting: Can be triggered, but rn only inventory is without desync, and sometimes it does some fucky stuff with slots.
* Autofill: ~~non~~semifunctional (works but the slot layout has changed and needs to be fixed)
* Inventory shortcuts: Nonfunctional
* Config and config screen: **Functional**
* Inventory GUI / Buttons: They render and sort/open settings **but for some reason there's a server desync.**
* Packets (for Server-Assist): **Functional**

On a positive note, the mod compiles a doesn't crash the game.

## Description

This Open Source project (see [License](https://github.com/mkalam-alami/inventory-tweaks/blob/master/src/doc/license.txt)) is a client mod for [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/), a game by [Mojang AB](http://mojang.com/). It implements various features to help players with the management of inventories and chests. A lot of effort has been put to make it as customizable as possible, without being annoying to set up.
